# data backup policy template

once a week
- [ ] Back-up data from devices that contain work-related information
- [ ] Back up and notify managers of centralized data to updates/changes to password management databases
- [ ] Encrypt backup files themselves, or the devices they are stored

recommend to staff to backup personal devices weekly if they want to protect their personal data too
