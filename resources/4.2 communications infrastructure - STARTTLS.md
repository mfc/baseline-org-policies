## STARTTLS

* test using <https://checktls.com> or <https://starttls.info>
* type in `test@<email-provider-URL>`

* look at column `TLS Neg`
  -- if `OK`, it uses STARTTLS
  -- if `FAIL`, then you will need to implement STARTTLS on your mail 
server or move email providers

* look at column `Cert OK`
  -- if `OK`, it properly implements a TLS certificate
  -- if `FAIL`, you or your email provider needs to improve the TLS 
certificate used

## [Ramp-up] IMAP/SMTP to enable encrypted email

While this resource currently does not list encrypted email as a baseline practice for organizations, due to their threat and risk assessment they may be interested in implementing encrypted email.

If your organization uses a Microsoft Exchange server, you may need to 
enable IMAP on your Exchange server. Instructions to do so may be found 
in these Microsoft articles:

- [Office 365 Exchange Server](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2573225)
- [Exchange 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb124489(v=exchg.150).aspx)

If you are unable to enable IMAP on your Exchange server, you can 
investigate alternative methods of securing email.
