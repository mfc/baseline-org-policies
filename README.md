# [Baseline Organizational Policies and Practices](https://github.com/mfc/baseline-org-policies/blob/master/baseline%20security%20practices.md)

This is a draft of a resource that came out of envisioning the next iteration of the 
Responsible Data Forum's [Organizational Security Atomized Plan](https://github.com/the-engine-room/responsible-data/tree/master/organizational-security-atomized-plan), and reframing it as a guide towards implementation within a group. In 
this reframing I have relied heavily on the content of the Organizational Security 
Atomized Plan itself, Internews' [SAFETAG](https://github.com/OpenInternet/SAFETAG/) 
organizational assessment framework, and other resources listed in the 
resources section.  

The current approach is to provide: 

1. a description of a baseline organizational practice 

2. associated links to resources to help implement such a practice

3. a related template that a group could tailor or build upon to 
create a policy for the organization to implement

This is a *rough draft*. Please modify and improve it, and let me know what is helpful or not helpful! 

Thanks to the groups and organizations I've worked with whose needs 
instigated the creation of this resource, and for their patience as it 
continues to be developed.

Future plans for this resource include:

- [ ] adding more organizational policy templates
- [ ] getting it reviewed by the community, and feedback incorporated
- [ ] ramp-ups for topics about practices that further increase the 
security and safety of staff and communities
- [ ] stories or illustrations to better communicate the importance of 
these baseline practices
